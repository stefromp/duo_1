# Bimodal Gaussian noise schedule configuration
# From "Masked Diffusion Language Models with Frequency-Informed Training"
# (Kosmopoulou et al., 2025)
#
# Creates a mixture of two Gaussians:
# - Left mode: Low masking rates (fine-grained learning)
# - Right mode: Higher masking rates that increase during training
#
# IMPORTANT: This schedule requires derivative softening to achieve
# good performance. Set algo.derivative_power=0.1 or algo.derivative_power=0.0
#
# Use with: noise=bimodal-gaussian
type: bimodal-gaussian

# Left mode parameters (focused on low masking rates)
left_weight: 0.6      # Weight of left mode in mixture
left_mean: 0.12       # Mean masking rate for fine-grained learning
left_std: 0.02        # Standard deviation

# Right mode parameters (higher masking rates, time-varying)
right_mean_start: 0.4   # Starting mean at epoch 0
right_mean_end: 0.85    # Ending mean at final epoch
right_std: 0.08         # Standard deviation
