# Cosine noise schedule configuration
# From "Masked Diffusion Language Models with Frequency-Informed Training"
# (Kosmopoulou et al., 2025)
#
# The cosine schedule concentrates masking rates at lower values
# (expected mean ~0.36 vs 0.5 for linear), leading to better
# zero-shot performance.
#
# Use with: noise=cosine
type: cosine
